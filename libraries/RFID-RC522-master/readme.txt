This is the arduino code along with the RFID library to read RFID card using RC-522 RFID module.
The code used Software SPI pins. i.e. your SPI pins are not fixed, any pin of the arduino can be configured to act as any SPI pin.
The code uses DigitalIO library to make use of the Software SPI functionality.
you can download the DigitalIO library from: https://github.com/greiman/DigitalIO
